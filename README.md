# buildYourOwnBlockchain
I built my own blockchain based off of this tutorial: https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46.

This project is not an attempt to create new knowledge or further expand on blockchain technology, but instead a way for myself and others to better understand how blockchains and POW work.
